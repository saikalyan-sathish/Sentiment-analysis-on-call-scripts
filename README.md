# Call Scripts Sentiment Analysis Assignment

This project implements a sentiment analysis model for call center scripts. The primary goal is to classify whether the call script conveys positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for natural language processing (NLP) to understand and analyze text data from call scripts.

## Overview

The `Call Scripts Sentiment Analysis Assignment` is designed to analyze call center scripts and predict the sentiment of each conversation. The dataset consists of text-based scripts from call centers, and the goal is to determine whether the conversation conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment based on the text.

## Model Used

The model used in this project is based on a pre-trained transformer model, particularly **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), fine-tuned for sentiment analysis tasks.

### Why BERT?

BERT is a deep learning model that has revolutionized the way NLP tasks are approached. It leverages transformers to understand context in a bidirectional way, unlike previous models that only consider one direction. This makes BERT particularly effective for tasks like sentiment analysis, where understanding context is crucial.

BERT has been pre-trained on a massive corpus of text, making it highly effective for fine-tuning on specific tasks such as this sentiment analysis. It is especially adept at understanding subtle sentiment variations in text, which is essential for call center scripts that may contain ambiguous or nuanced emotions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for implementing the sentiment analysis model.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks used to build and train the model.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: A library used to implement and fine-tune the BERT model.
- **Streamlit**: Used to create a simple interactive frontend for displaying results.
- **Vercel**: Deployed the application for hosting and production.

## Project Implementation

### Step 1: Setup Environment

First, ensure that you have the necessary Python environment setup. You can create a virtual environment and install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing

The next step is to preprocess the raw text data. This involves:

- Removing special characters and numbers.
- Tokenizing the text data.
- Padding or truncating the text sequences to a fixed length for feeding into the model.

```python
# Example of text preprocessing
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
inputs = tokenizer(text_data, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')
```

### Step 3: Model Training

The BERT model is fine-tuned on the dataset for the sentiment classification task. The model architecture consists of:

- A **BERT encoder** to process the input text.
- A **classification head** on top of the BERT model to output the sentiment class.

The training involves adjusting the weights of the model to minimize the loss on a labeled dataset.

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Define the model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

### Step 4: Model Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a test set to assess its performance. This step involves calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

```python
# Evaluate the model
results = trainer.evaluate()
print(f"Test Accuracy: {results['eval_accuracy']}")
```

### Step 5: Deployment

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface. The frontend is hosted on **Vercel**, and the backend is handled by **Flask**.

1. **Streamlit** serves the frontend and allows users to input text for sentiment analysis.
2. **Flask** handles the API requests and runs the model in the backend.

To deploy:

1. Create a `start.sh` script to start the Streamlit app.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.headless=true
```

2. Ensure the `app.py` is properly set up to handle requests.

Then, deploy it to Vercel using:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Usage

Once deployed, the application will be available via a public URL. Users can visit the URL, input call script text, and the model will predict whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.

### Key Points:
- Use triple backticks (` ``` `) to wrap code blocks for proper formatting.
- Links like `[LICENSE](LICENSE)` will automatically convert to clickable links if a `LICENSE` file exists in the repo.
- Markdown headings like `##` and `###` are used to organize content into sections.
